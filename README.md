# Case intensity prediction for the GGD's AO team

With this project, I obtained my Master's degree in Data Science & Society at Tilburg University. As the case data belonged to the GGD, it's not included in this repository and it's therefore not operable. However, notebooks and functions can be reviewed and the thesis report is included.
